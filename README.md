# go-adb

Go ADB library.

- Full control over timeouts and cancellation.
- High-level idiomatic Go wrappers around common functionality.
- Access to low-level protocol details where required.
- All errors are checked.
- Focused on modern APIs; legacy ADB behaviour is not a priority.
- Highly extensible.

> [!WARNING]
> This library is a work-in-progress. Only parts of it have been fully tested, and the API is experimental and subject to change.
